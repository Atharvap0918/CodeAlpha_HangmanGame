# Hangman Game

This repository contains a simple text-based Hangman game developed as part of the Python Programming Internship at CodeAlpha. The game is designed to reinforce basic Python programming concepts such as control flow, string manipulation, functions, and loops.

## Project Objective

To implement a functional version of the classic Hangman word-guessing game using Python. The player is allowed a limited number of incorrect guesses and must uncover the hidden word by guessing one letter at a time.

## Features

- Console-based interface with clear prompts and feedback
- Predefined list of five English words
- Maximum of six incorrect guesses allowed
- ASCII art representation of hangman stages
- Input validation for non-alphabetic and repeated guesses
- Option to replay the game after completion

## Technologies Used

- Python 3.13.5
- Built-in modules: `random`, `input`, `print`

## How to Run

1. Ensure Python 3 is installed on your system.
2. Clone the repository or download the source code.
3. Navigate to the project directory and run the script:

```bash
python hangman.py
